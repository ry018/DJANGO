I've built a CRM application using Django for backend, Mysql for database, html and Bootstrap CSS for frontend.
In this application a user can perform the following:
      Register as new user
      Login/Logout
      Add record      -    'C'
      View Record     -    'R'
      Update record   -    'U'
      Detele record   -    'D'
Through this basic operations we can catchup with most of the operations and functionalites, any addition feature might repeat the same functions.
